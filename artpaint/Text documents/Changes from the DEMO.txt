Changes that should be copied from DEMO (19/9/97) to the official version.

	-	The saving and loading of preferences has changed (especially tool preferences are now saved as a whole structs)

	-	The image-save-panel is now better

	-	The whole selected-area and the selector-tool are improved. This results in changes to tool setup-window also.



No changes should be copied any more it is dangerous and leads to trouble. All features should rather be re-implemented.

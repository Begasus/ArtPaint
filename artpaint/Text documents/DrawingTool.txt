DrawingTool-classes

-	Each drawing tool has it's own class that defines the functions that do the
	drawing. The class also has storage for all the settings of the tool and
	also has a function that creates the needed views for the setup.

-	DrawingTool is a base class that each individual tool-class inherits from.
	This class has no actual functionality, but it defines the common 
	elements (such as the name) for each tool.

LayerWindow

LayerWindow displays the layers of an image:

	-	Layers of one image are displayed at a time
	-	The image to be displayed is that of last active paint-window 
		or some other paint-window if last active was closed and no 
		other paint-window was activated since
	-	The image must be able to inform layer-window whenever
		it has been changed.
	-	Layer-window must inform the image if it is going to shut down.
	-	Layer-window must inform the image that is the new target image.
	-	Operations in a layer-window might affect the image.
	-	All messaging that concerns the existence of layer-window should
		be synchronous.

Tool-images in the resources

Tool-images are saved into app's resources. They have the type of B_COLOR_8_BIT and they are stored as a stream of bytes.  The length of data is 32*32*1 = 1024 for the big icons and 16*16*1 = 256 for the small images. In order to create an icon for a tool, we need to have all four images for that tool present in the resources. The icons are numbered in the following manner (i.e. their Id's are the following).

	BIG_ICON_ON		a01
	BIG_ICON_OFF		a02
	SMALL_ICON_ON	a03
	SMALL_ICON_OFF	a04

Here a is a number that indicates what tool the icon belongs to. The following list describes the 'a'-values reserved so far. It will be updated whenever new
tool-images are created.

	NO_TOOL					a=10
	SIMPLE_TEST_TOOL			a=20
	SELECTOR_TOOL			a=30
	FILL_TOOL					a=40
	RECTANGLE_TOOL			a=50
	ELLIPSE_TOOL				a=60
	STRAIGHT_LINE_TOOL		a=70
	BRUSH_TOOL				a=80
	BLUR_TOOL					a=90
	COLOR_SELECTOR_TOOL	a=100
	TRANSPARENCY_TOOL		a=110
	AIR_BRUSH_TOOL			a=120
	SELECTION_TOOL			a=130
	HAIRY_BRUSH_TOOL		a=140
	ERASER_TOOL				a=150
	TEXT_TOOL					a=160


The ON-icons are images where the button is pressed down and the off-images are ones where the button is up.


The next values of 'a' indicate images for other buttons than just tools.

	OK_BUTTON						a=11
	CANCEL_BUTTON				a=21

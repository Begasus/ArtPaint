ArtPaint Tool-Settings File Format

The tools' settings are stored in a single file. That file has the following structure.

This is the header:
int32	is_little_endian	(0x00000000 or 0xFFFFFFFF, no or yes)
int32	file_id_number	(0x12345678)
int32	settings_file_version_number

The next structure is repeated for each tool:
int32	tool_id
int32 tool_settings_length
int32 tool_settings_version
Here is the actual settings for the tool (tool_settings_length-4 bytes)

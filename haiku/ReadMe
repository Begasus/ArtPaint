How to get and build ArtPaint.

ArtPaint can be checked out through anonymous access with the following command:
svn checkout svn://svn.osdrawer.net/svnroot/artpaint/trunk artpaint

Developers can checkout through svn+ssh with the following command:
svn checkout svn+ssh://developername@svn.osdrawer.net/svnroot/artpaint/trunk artpaint


There are two ways to build ArtPaint, i will describe first what to do when cross compiling:

Please note, unlike the SCM Webpage states, make sure the your svn command ends with 'trunk'.
This is especially important if you are going to try to build ArtPaint with Haiku's native
Jamfile engine. The included Jamfiles expects ArtPaint's source code to be checked out into
Haiku's 3rdparty folder.

After successfully ckecking out the source your hard disk layout should look something like this:

haiku |
		- build
		- data
		- docs
		- headers
		- src
		- 3rdparty |
					- artpaint |
								- addons
								- artpaint
								- haiku
								- Jamfile

Now there is only one more step required to get ArtPaint onto your Haiku image,
cd into your Haiku source root and issue jam haiku-vmware-image or jam haiku-image.
Of course you must have configured Haiku with

./configure --include-3rdparty <some other options>

how to do this refer to Haiku's configure while invoked with configure --help.


In case you did not configure haiku with 3rdparty enabled, we provide you with a
pre configured UserBuildConfig file, to use it or it's content cd into
3rdparty/artpaint/haiku and copy the content of the UserBuildConfig to your
default UserBuildConfig used to build Haiku.

If you didn't setup a UserBuildConfig yet, please read the file UserBuildConfig.ReadMe
to be found under build/jam/UserBuildConfig.ReadMe and reuse build/jam/UserBuildConfig.sample
to setup your own UserBuildConfig.

After invoking a simple jam haiku-image or jam haiku-vmware-image ArtPaint should be
properly copied onto your image.


There is a second way, most likely when compiling Haiku on Haiku:

Check out the source as described above, then simple call jam ArtPaintPackage. This
will generate a zip file containing all AddOns, Documention files as well as ArtPaint.

You can find it most likely in your Haikus generated folder under:
{HAIKU_SOURCE_DIR}/generated/objects/packages/haiku/x86/release/ArtPaintPackage/install.zip

Unzip the file, it will contain a second zip call install.zip and a file called install.sh,
simply double click the install.sh and choose one of the provided otions. This will install
ArtPaint into its proper folder, as well create a symlink in the Haiku Deskbar.

Of course you need the Haiku source code and build tools set up and build properly.



Have fun!

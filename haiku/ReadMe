How to get and build ArtPaint.

ArtPaint can be checked out through anonymous access with the following command:
svn checkout svn://svn.osdrawer.net/svnroot/artpaint/trunk artpaint

Developers can checkout through svn+ssh with the following command:
svn checkout svn+ssh://developername@svn.osdrawer.net/svnroot/artpaint/trunk artpaint


Please note, unlike the SCM Webpage states, make sure the your svn command ends with 'trunk'.
This is especially important if you are going to try to build ArtPaint with Haiku's native
Jamfile engine. The included Jamfiles expects ArtPaint's source code to be checked out into
Haiku's 3rdparty folder.

After successfully ckecking out the source your hard disk layout should look something like this:

haiku |
		- build
		- data
		- docs
		- headers
		- src
		- 3rdparty |
					- artpaint |
								- addons
								- artpaint
								- haiku
								- Jamfile

Now there is only one more step required to get ArtPaint onto your Haiku image,
cd into 3rdparty/artpaint/haiku and copy the content of the UserBuildConfig to
your default UserBuildConfig used to build Haiku.

If you didn't setup a UserBuildConfig yet, please read the file UserBuildConfig.ReadMe
to be found under build/jam/UserBuildConfig.ReadMe and reuse build/jam/UserBuildConfig.sample
to setup your own UserBuildConfig.

After invoking a simple jam haiku-image or jam haiku-vmware-image ArtPaint should be
properly copied onto your image. Of course you must have configured Haiku with

./configure --include-3rdparty <some other options>

how to do this refer to Haiku's configure while invoked with configure --help.

Have fun!

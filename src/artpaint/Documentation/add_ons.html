<H2>Add-ons</H2>
Much of ArtPaint's functionality comes through add-ons. Add-ons are small programs that ArtPaint can load to do some specific job. Everyone can make their own add-ons with the help of ArtPaint Add-on Developer Kit (to be released soon), and some knowledge of programming the BeOS. The add-ons can be accessed through <A HREF="./paint_window.html">paint-window</A>'s Add-Ons-menu. Currently all add-ons affect only one <A HREF="./layers.html">layer</A> at a time.
<H3>Installing new add-ons</H3>
When new add-ons come available they can be installed by copying the add-on-file to either of following locations:
<UL>
<LI>To ArtPaint's folder's subfolder named add-ons
<LI>or to /boot/home/config/add-ons/ArtPaint/ 
</UL>

<H3>Descriptions of the included add-ons</H3>
This part describes shortly the add-ons that are included with the program.
<DL>
<DT>Blur
<DD>Opens a window that allows you to adjust the blurriness of the image with a slider. The blur is reflected on the image when you let go of the slider.
<DT>Brightness
<DD>Opens a window that allows you to adjust the brightness of the image with a slider. The change in brightness is reflected on the image right when you move the slider.
<DT>Color Balance
<DD>Opens a window that has three sliders for controlling the amount of red, green and blue color in the image. The change in color-balance is reflected in the image at the moment you move the sliders.
<DT>Contrast
<DD>Opens a window that has a slider for adjusting the contrast of the image. The change in contrst is reflected in the image right away.
<DT>Stretch Histogram
<DD>Improves the contrast of the image by stretcing its histogram to maximum possible length. If the image contains pure black and pure white this operation will do nothing.
<DT>Dispersion
<DD>Changes the pixels positions in the image randomly a little bit to create a "dispersed" look.
<DT>Emboss
<DD>Creates an emboss effect on the image.
<DT>Greyscale
<DD>Converts the image into greyscale.
<DT>Halftone
<DD>Creates a halftone-pattern on the image. The foreground-color is used to color the dark parts and the background-color is used to color the light parts.
<DT>Negative
<DD>Creates a negative image of the picture by inverting every color. The inversion is done in RGB-color-space
<DT>Oil
<DD>Creates a pattern on the image that tries to simulate the effect of painting the image with brush strokes.
<DT>Saturation
<DD>Opens a window that contains a slider for controlling the saturation of the image. The effect is reflected on the image right when the slider is moved.
<DT>Twirl
<DD>Makes a twirl-effect on the image. Opens a window with two sliders for controlling the size and the direction of the twirl. The center for the twirl can be set by clicking on the image and dragging around.
<DT>Wave
<DD>Creates a circular wave effect on the image. Opens a window that controls sliders for controlling the length and the strength of the wave. The wave center can be adjusted by clicking on the image with the mouse and dragging around.
<DT>PerlinWood
<DD>Creates a wood-like texture over the image.

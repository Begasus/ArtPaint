<H2>Registration</H2>
<H3>ArtPaint is a shareware program</H3>
ArtPaint is a freely distributable shareware program. The current version can be used freely without registering, but registering has a few benefits:
<UL>
<LI>Registering removes that nasty dialog that appears whenever the program is started and every now and then when the program is running.
<LI>Registering ensures that you get up to date information about new versions of the program and new addons.
<LI>Registering helps to keep the development for ArtPaint going on.
<LI>Registering allows you to use all 1.X versions of ArtPaint without any limitations.
</UL>
Currently the registration fee is amazingly low, only 20$. The price will probably increase in the future as ArtPaint improves, so it may be wise to register now rather than wait.
<P>
Whether or not you decide to register I will gladly receive <A HREF="mailto:Heikki.Suhonen@Helsinki.FI">e-mail</A> from you telling what you think of the program. 
<P>
<H3>How to register</H3>
The registration procedure is quite simple.
<OL>
<LI>Write a letter to the following address:
	<PRE>
		Heikki Suhonen
		Norkkokatu 25
		48770 Karhula
		Finland
	</PRE>
<P>
<LI>Put a note inside the letter that contains at least your name and e-mail address. You can also include your address or phone number if you like, but they are not that important at the moment. All the information that you send will remain confidental and none of it will be redistributed.
<P>
<LI>Put 20$ (US dollars) inside the letter so that it cannot be seen from the outside (you can for example wrap the money inside a piece of dark paper).
<P>
<LI>Put the letter to the mail. You are encouraged to use airmail as it is much faster than non airmail.
<P>
<LI>Optionally you can <A HREF="mailto:Heikki.Suhonen@Helsinki.FI">e-mail me</A> telling that you have sent the registration so that I know to expect it and can send you a reply right after I have received your letter.
</OL>
When I have received your letter I will send you a keyfile through e-mail that prevents the annoying window from appearing. You should copy the keyfile to the following location on your hard-drive:
<PRE>	/boot/home/config/settings/ArtPaint/
</PRE>
You will receive more detailed instructions on installing the keyfile after you have registered.

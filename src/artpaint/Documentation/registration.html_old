ArtPaint is a shareware program, although the current version does not have any shareware-limitations. This means that if you use ArtPaint much you should register the program by sending some money to the author. It is not illegal to use the program without registering, but it is against the good spirit. However if you feel that for some reason you cannot register even though you would like to, please drop <A HREF="mailto:Heikki.Suhonen@Helsinki.FI">me</A> a line. This way I can get to know what are the biggest problems in the registration procedure and get motivated to fix them. Currently the registration fee is $20US.

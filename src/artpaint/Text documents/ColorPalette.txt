ArtPaint ColorPalette

ColorPalette should have the following properties:

	-	Separate color should be selectable for each mouse-button
		maybe even two colors for each

	-	User should be able to define a set of colors that are most
		commonly used for quick selection. These sets could be saved
		and loaded. When opening such set the filepanel should display
		sets colors. Several sets could be open at any one time for quick
		changing between them.

	-	It should be possible to define new colors in many different ways.
		One method would be RGBA-sliders, other could be HSV-sliders.
		Many other methods should also be made available.

	-	ColorSelectors should act a little bit differently depending whether
		they are being displayed on an 8-bit or 32-bit screen.

	-	It should be possible to control color with an external controller.
		When this is the case each color-set should contain a special
		entry that reflects the controllers values.

	-	It should be also possible to quickly define a color with the sliders
		and start using it without the need to use color sets.

	-	Whenever user selects a color it should become the active color for
		that mousebutton that the selection was made with.

	-	User could also set the preferences so that every button has the
		same color. 

	-	The alpha value of color should not propably be controlled here
		but somewhere else. Also user should be able to determine
		whether the alpha-value is used to mix between layers or
		within the layer.

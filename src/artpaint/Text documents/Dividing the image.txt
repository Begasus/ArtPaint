The following code can be used to divide the image into horizontal strips when using multiple threads to calculate something.

	int32 height = area.Height() / number_of_threads + 1; 
	BRect rect = area;
	rect.top = min_c(area.bottom, area.top + i*height);
	rect.bottom = min_c(area.bottom,rect.top+height-1);

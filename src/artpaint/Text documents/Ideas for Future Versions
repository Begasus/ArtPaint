Ideas for Future Versions


This document contains some ideas that can not be implemented in the first realease version, but might be intresting to implement in later versions.


	1.	Input manipulators. These would handle the drawing input, and they could be put in line one 
		handling the input after the other. e.g:
			Input--->Grid---->Pressure Quantizer---->Color fader---->Drawing tool

	3.	More that 24-bits per pixel. Nonlinear color-mapping.

	4.	Masks for layers

	5.	Names for layers

	6.	Multiple default-settings for manipulators and user storable settings too

	7.	Possibility to use any convolution filter with a tool, like with Blur. The filter function could 
		come from an add-on.

	8.	Tool add-ons.

	9.	Different kinds of mixing between layers. Add-ons for this too.

	10.	New types of gradient fills with more control over the result.

	11.	Painting with textures

	12.	Selection -> Brush, like in Deluxe Paint and Brilliance

	13.	Antialiasing to all of the tools (where it is applicible)

	14.	Improvements to selections. 
		-	Possibility to drag and rotate easily. 
		-	Possibility to have fuzzy selections (i.e. a level of selectedness). 
		-	Smoother edges for selections (i.e. antialiasing)
		-	Draggable to other applications or to brush-window

	15.	Dockable tool-bars and tool-setup view.

	16.	Numeric controls for color-selection.

	17.	Buttons with pictures to replace some checkboxes and radio-buttons

	18.	Guides over the image and snap-to guides. Each guideline adjustable independently

	19.	Better drawing of lines over the image. Instead of B_OP_INVERT use some better
		labeling technique.

	20.	Multiple views of the same document.

	21.	CMYK color-model. Notice the K.

	22.	Internal handling of images in other than just BGRA format (see idea 3) 

	23.	Better use of memory.
		-	Get rid of the extra copies of each layer if possible
		-	Layer divided into smaller areas and only some of them allocated
		-	Undo-queue stores the oldest events automatically to disk
		-	Very large images loaded only partially (requires a special fileformat)
			FlashPix?
	
	24.	Auto-save and exporting (get rid of current save as and save)

	25.	Better interoperability with other applications (copy-paste and drag-n-drop)
	
	26.	A clipboard manager with a window to allow a 'clippings desk'

	27.	Ability for add-ons to draw over the background too

	28.	Possibility to create scripts of actions.

	29.	Finishing of effects in a background thread while allowing editing of the image at the same 
		time.

	30.	A free transform tool for individual layers and selections (rotate,translate,scale)
 
	31.	Cross hair that extends from cursor to the edges.

	32.	Watercolor like painting tool

	33.	Adjustable width for the edge lines in rectangel-tool and ellipse tool

	34.	Rotation for ellipse-tool

	35.	Better brush editor that is incorporated into the brush-window

	36.	All tools should have live data control hooks so that external thread can adjust the 
		properties for a tool. This should for example allow pressure sensitive pens and some 
		other input methods that control other than the cursor position. 

	37.	A good gradient editor with saveable and loadable gradients.

	38.	Gradient to be used in every tool and not just the fill-tool.

	39.	Smooth spline interpolation for tools like brush-tool and free-hand tool

	40.	Improvements to text-tool
		-	Faster operation
		-	Possibility to individually position and rotate each letter
		-	Possibility to have different font for each letter
		-	Saveable settings
	
	41.	Improvements to undo-system
		-	Possibility to turn off any event in the buffer (not just the latest)
		-	Possibility to change the parameters for any event in the buffer
		-	Possibility to form a script from the events in the buffer
		-	Undo painter tool.	

	42.	Script recording and execution. Same operations can be performed on multiple images.
		Saveable scripts and a batch processing mode.

	43.	 Possibility to add comments to the project-file (perhaps an indexed attribute?)

	44.	Saving some of the preferences along with the project-file. On option whether to use
		projects own settings or the global settings (applies at least to text-tool and perhaps add
		-ons).

	45.	Compression for project-files. Perhaps a block-model with Lempel-Ziv variant coding. 
		Lossless.

	46.	Better shortcut keys for the paint-window. Shortcuts should work event if some other 
		window in ArtPaint is active. In this case the shortcuts would be directed to the window
		that was last active.

	47.	New and better looking icons for all purposes within the program. Icons should have a 
		consistent style and they should be quite simple. 

	48.	Thumbnail preview when loading images and projects. The preview-image could be stored 
		as an attribute to the files.

	49.	Preview when saving an image so that the change of format and its parameters can be
		easily seen.

	50.	Possibility to draw (GUI)lines that go across the image and continue over the background.

	51.	New manipulator add-ons
		-	Painter
		-	Gaussian blur
		-	Lens flare
		-	Motion blur (with freely adjustable blur path and highlight control)
		-	Mosaic
		-	Texture generator (like PerlinWood but with many adjustable parameters)
		-	Lighting system
		-	Render system
		-	Lightning generator (adjustable end-points and degree of complexity)
		-	L-system generator
		-	Better add-on for adjusting colors, tones and levels
		-	Warping
		-	Ripple generator
		-	Controllable halftone add-on with artistic halftones (artistic screening)			

	52.	Interpolation and extrapolation between layers.
		
	53.	Preview when dragging and dropping a clipping or another image over the image.
 
	54.	Customizable tool-bars, where a button for any operation can be put (including but not
		limited to manipulator add-ons).

	55.	Different painting modes:
		-	add
		-	subtract
		-	lighten
		-	darken
		-	min
		-	max
		-	blend
		-	invert
		-	replace (normal)

	56.	Remember parts of the image that go out of the actual bounds in some transformation.

	57.	Multiple types of layers
		-	Normal
		-	Text layer
		-	Effect layer

	58.	Tool for drawing arcs. First define the radius and one endpoint and then define the angle.

	59.	Multiple units when setting the image size and also in the coordinate display box.

	60.	Euclidian distance display in the coordinate display box in addition to manhattan distance.

	61.	Possibility to easily save any part of the image. See also ideas 12 and 14.

	62.	Nonrectangular images.	For example ellipse shaped image that could be exported as such
		to some other programs and they would realize it is an ellipse shaped image.

	63.	Possibility to add vector graphics objects to any layer. These could be importable from 
		some vector drawing program.

	64.	A tool for drawing polygons and triangles, and possibility to make also selections polygon
		shaped.

	65.

Ideas for utility functions and classes


1.	BRect return_image_rectangle(BPoint center,int width,int height)

	This function would return a rectangle from the image that matches the above
	parameters best. width and height should not be altered unless the image is
	smaller than them.


2.	An image-processing library that contains standard functions like blur, gaussian,
	blur,â€¦. These can be used in add-ons to preprocess the image as needed.
